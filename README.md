# Advanced_Solidity_Homework

This contract creates an ERC20 token that will be minted through a Crowdsale contract that you can leverage from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.
This crowdsale contract will manage the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).
This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
using the Crowdsale, CappedCrowdsale, TimedCrowdsale, RefundableCrowdsale, and MintedCrowdsale.

This program uses the addresses off of Ganache and once its compiled connect metamask to supply the funds and the ganache wallet to receive the funds

Where this coin differs is that not only are we working with wei and ether we also have puppercoin which you cant really convert to here.
